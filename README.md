# Task Board Management Application

[Deployed Task Board](https://willzovo94.github.io/Task-board-management-application/)



## Description 
- This assignment includes a functional task board application. It provides functional Javascript and uses Jquery API... especially JqueryUI which helps store user inputs into local storage using a modal. Using this data in local storage, the application shows task cards which can be organized by the user with dragging features.
- My motivation for working through this project was to learn a lot more about APIs and Javascript. It taught me how to access APIs to really provide functionality with web pages... Including the droppable and draggable methods.

## Usage
- You're given a responsive task board that is ready for adding new tasks.

- Once you click the new task button, you're given a modal that takes in user input.

- Then the user will see their information put on a task card. The color is based on if the card is past due, on the due date, or due later. Also, a given delete button to organize and delete tasks if required

- user data is stored on local storage.

## Features
- Access to add task button which intakes your input.
- Draggable and droppable task cards
- Delete task button, which helps delete tasks you don't need or accomplish.
- You can see data organized in local storage.
